## Welcome to Procedural Island Generation

### The below link is a demonstration of the project
https://github.com/Darryn-Wong/procedural-island-generation/edit/master/README.md

### Terrain 
- uses a perlin map to randomly generate islands

### Trees and Flowers
- They are randomly droped from the air
- If the object does not land on a valid terrain it will be destoryed
  1. Uses raycast to detect the angle of the terrain 
  2. Use Layers to detect if its landing on the terrain
